# The Raven
## by Edgar Allen Poe
Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "Tapping at my chamber door.
"Only this, and nothing more."
