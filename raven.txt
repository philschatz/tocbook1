# The Raven
## by Edgar L. N. Poe
Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "Tapping at my chamber door.
"Only this, and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow 
From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore —
                                   Nameless here for evermore
